my_tb3 is my take on how to write a urdf file in ros2 just some .so files have changed which you can check on gazebo_ros pkg in github to see all the plugins name. model.sdf is for tb3 in ros 2 you can use it to spawn but I don't think robot state publisher can use sdf and it needs urdf so I prefered to right my_tb3.urdf.xacro to be able to hit two birds with one stone and urdf.xacro is just a convention which means by using xacro command you can convert it to urdf. turtlebot3_waffle_pi.urdf is the urdf file that tb3 guys provided for robot state publisher and turtlebot3_waffle.urdf.xacro and turtlebot3_waffle.gazebo.xacro is for ros 1 which is used them to write my_tb3.urdf.xacro. you just have to write them one by one and with some minor changes voilla! you have a nice urdf for tb3. remeber to use gazebo tags in urdf you have to use gazebo tag search gazebo tag in xacro in google and somethings are weird like in sdf file the wheels are revolute but when you use that in xacro file you'd have specify limits of the joint. and nayway your wheel can't move past some point. so its wrong and the right way is to use continuous in you xacro files
